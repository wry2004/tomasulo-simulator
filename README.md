**Design a Tomasulo algorithm simulator using Python** that can read `.s`/`.asm` files and display the scheduling process and performance statistics of the algorithm. It should be configured with three `.s` files:  
- One representing a scheduling scenario with no conflicts.  
- One where there is at least one RAW (Read After Write) conflict.  
- One where there is at least one WAR (Write After Read) conflict.
